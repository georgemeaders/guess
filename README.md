Guessing Game
The idea behind this guessing game is that a color is chosen that 
the computer is thinking of and the user has three tried to guess that color.  If they guess correctly they are given a congratulations message and if they guess incorrectly, they are told that as well and given another chance to guess (up to three chances).  These congratulatory messages are different depending on what # guess they;re on.
